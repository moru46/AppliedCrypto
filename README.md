# Online messaging service
The development of an online secure messaging service involves creating a platform that allows users to communicate with one another in a way that ensures their messages are kept confidential and protected from unauthorized access. To achieve this, the service will utilize the TCP protocol as the underlying communication protocol, which provides reliable and ordered data transmission between the users.

In addition, to ensure the security of the messages transmitted over the service, secure programming protocols such as AES256, PFS, HMAC, and many others will be implemented. AES256 is a widely used encryption algorithm that provides high levels of security by encrypting messages using a 256-bit key. PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) is a security protocol that ensures that if one message key is compromised, previous and future keys are not affected. HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) is a message authentication protocol that ensures message integrity and verifies the authenticity of the sender.

The use of these secure programming protocols will ensure that the messages sent between two or more users are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access or interception. The encryption and decryption of messages will be handled on the client-side, so that only the sender and intended recipients of the message will have access to the unencrypted message.

Overall, the development of an online secure messaging service using TCP protocol and secure programming protocols will provide users with a reliable and secure platform for communicating with one another, while maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of their messages.
